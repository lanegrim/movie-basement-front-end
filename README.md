# Movie Basement
Movie Basement is a movie-journaling and rating app.

## Technologies Used
### Front End
- JavaScript
- React.JS
### Back End
- Python
- Django
- Postgres

## Approach
We initially set out to create a full-CRUD app using a React front end and a Django back end. With our mutual love for movies at the center of the project, we have attempted to create a space for fellow movie-lovers to create catalogues of their favorite (and least favorite) films, complete with ratings. In order to make the process of building and maintaining a collection of entries as seamless as possible, we have integrated the OMDB API to allow users to search for data when creating new entries.

At its core, this project has been an exercise in collaborating to build a multi-component React app.

## Opportunities for Improvement/Expansion
- We haven't yet had the time to implment authentication, but we see an opportunity to allow users to create more personalized experiences within the app. This feature would also allow us to restrict what data users are able to see and interact with, depending on ownership.
- We would also like to implement a search feature and sorting functionality for users' individual collections.
